      <p>I’m an accredited Real Estate Agent. I help match the right people with suitable properties in Windsor-Essex. With extensive experience in sales and customer service, I was born in Lebanon and moved to Canada over 31 years ago; I am a mother of two beautiful girls and one amazing stepdaughter, a friend to some of the most amazing people I know, a daughter of one of the most muscular women that ever lived. <br> <br>

Windsor is home by choice. I love the city and everything it offers, especially the genuine people I had the pleasure to get to know throughout the years. <br> <br>

I am very active in the Community, and I volunteer at a few organizations. I am an active member of The Giving Eight, a non-profit organization that supports Windsor- Essex County. <br> <br>

I offer a total commitment to providing my clients with assistance in all aspects of real estate. <br> <br>

I make it a point to stay involved throughout all stages of the real estate process. I’ll guide you every step of the way, whether you’re looking to buy, sell or rent. Book an appointment today!</p>
